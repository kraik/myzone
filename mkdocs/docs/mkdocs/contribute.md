# Contributing to the Operations Documentation, Served by MkDocs

MkDocs is the static site generator used to build out documentation, the theme being used for this site is [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

The following sections will give you instructions on how to properly make changes to the documentation and get them added to the github pages website. If you have questions or confusion about the documentation, please reach out to the [CloudOps team on slack](https://amino24i.slack.com/archives/C03H7V6CDEY) and send a message via `@team-cloudops`.

## Prerequisites

Using MkDocs to build your documentation is simple and fun (we love beautiful documentation here), with many team members being able to participate. However, there is a certain level of technical details that contributors need to understand before proceding. Not understanding these prerequisites will cause you to lost time and many headaches down the road. You do not have to be an expert at these concepts to continue, but before continuing forward, please have an understanding of the following:
